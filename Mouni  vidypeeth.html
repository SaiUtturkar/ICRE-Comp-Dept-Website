<p>Shri Mouni Vidyapeeth was established in the year 1951 with following Motto,
"Rural reconstruction through education and education through rural reconstruction."

Right from it's inception education has been the soul of Shri Mouni Vidyapeeth and will remain for ever. Total social upliftment of rural masses is a hurricane task, but it is still the ultimate goal of Shri Mouni Vidyapeeth. Shri Mouni Maharaj is the guru of great Maratha warrior Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Shri Mouni Vidyapeeth is rightly named in memory of this great saint. Knowledge, service, devotion and simpleness are few his main teaching themes and these are nutured by Shri Mouni Vidyapeeth in a very effective manner.

Shri Mouni Vidyapeeth is educational laboratory where new techniques & methods of educational are evolved. These methods and techniques are experimented to educate the rural masses. A new vision for development is provided by Shri Mouni Vidyapeeth
To rural masses all along from its inception and still wishes to provide it under the changed scenario through its huge infrastructure in the area of information and technology.

In the last two decades there have been many changes in the educational field reconstruction of education and reconstruction of educational techniques have been the main objectives of these changes Shri Mouni Vidyapeeth is all along it's development has contributed substantially towards these changes. Shri Mouni Vidyapeeth is not just located in rural area, but is also working hard for surrounding area. The shortage of funds, insufficient infrastructure, and remoteness of its location in comparison to other institutes never stood between Shri Mouni Vidyapeeth and development of its surrounding society.

At present under the umbrella of Shri Mouni Vidyapeeth there are 19 different educational institutes, 10 boy's & girl's hostels, one grand play ground, gymnasium, over 40 staff quarters, guest house, an auditorium wit11 reading halls etc. Are spread over more than 65 acres of land cushioned in between hills on both sides while river vedganga on other two sides. A fully residential naturally picturesque campus breath education round the clock and is well renounced all over India.

Without the services of its founders, late Raosaheb V. T. Patil & great educationist Padmbhushan Dr. J. P. Naik and contribution of local people Shri Mouni Vidyapeeth would not have been what it is today. Commencement of new courses and upcoming "engineering college" Shri Mouni Vidyapeeth is now poised for great leap forward......
